    <p>First, I'd like to start off with hi! I'm Lanihya. Sometimes, I find it hard to really introduce myself unless
        I'm being asked specific things like, “what's your favorite color” or “what do you want to be when you
        graduate”. It's funny because I love to talk about myself and explain who I am to people but I never know how to
        start. One thing about me is I like to go by the beat of my own drum. I like to do things flexibly and be able
        to use my creativity with very little rules. I'm more of an extroverted introvert. Now that may sound confusing
        but it's more like I don't mind meeting new people and having a great conversation with them, but if you see me
        I'm most likely hanging out with my boyfriend or my family rather than making friends and hanging out with them.
    </p>
    <p>When it comes to work I have one specific mindset. If I'm passionate about it, I'll exceed everyone’s
        expectations. I don't like to do the bare minimum or be like everyone else. Everything I do has the potential to
        be the best. I'm a perfectionist. If it's not perfect to my standards, the world won't see it.
